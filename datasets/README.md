We don’t have much information on the definition of those 18 “parent levels” and the 237 “handcrafted levels”. But there are a lot of different levels here:  https://github.com/deepmind/lab/tree/master/game_scripts/levelsCheck out this paper which claims SOTA with an IMPALA agent on DM Lab 30:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.04474v1.pdf                                                 	|

They use a D4PG agent to collect data from tasks with state features, and an MPO based agent to collect data with pixels. They also collect data for randomized versions of the control suite tasks with a D4PG agent. They randomize the actuator gear, joint range, stiffness, and damping and geom size and density from a small interval and a large interval.There are some SOTA agents here :https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/deepmind-control-suite 	|
